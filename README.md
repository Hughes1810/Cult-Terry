## A Really Okay Intro to Python

---

MSBA people: let me know if there are any specific things you want me to work in here. 

Planned stuff is: regression (probably 2), classification (normal and anomaly detection), clustering , NLP (at least 2).

#### Quickstart:
If you’ve already forked this and are reading it in your favorite IDE then skip to whichever section you’d like my 2 cents on.  
If that didn’t make any sense, read on!  
1. Download Anaconda
    1. [click here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
    2. scroll down a little until you see some OS tabs, and download buttons
    3. download the 3.x distribution, python 2 isn't relevant
    4. maybe make yourself a coffee or a snack, you deserve it
    5. to run: open the Anaconda app, or open a terminal and type "jupyter lab"
2. Make a github account
    1. there aren't any steps, this one is on you
3. Fork
    1. in the upper right, click the button that says fork
4. Clone
    1. on the right side, copy *HTTPS clone URL* 
    2. decide where you want to stash it (maybe in a folder called school in /Documents)
    3. open terminal and change directory to the location ("\$ cd /Documents/school")
    4. enter and run "\$ git clone *HTTPS*"
5. Enjoy!

#### Contents:

*generally ordered by complexity. knowledge/installs will build (i.e. if you skip 2. then I assume you're comfortable with pandas)*

* Beginner -
1. Data Structures: overview of ways to structure data, and some elementary programming things
2. Data Framing: overview of dataframes, “data munging,” pandas, and numpy
3. Data Scraping: Selenium, accessing data that can't just be downloaded
4. Functions: class-derived example of a monte carlo simulation
5. NLP-1: word clouds, and easy NLP

#### Disclaimer:
- I’m not the best - or even particularly good - at python.
- This won’t be comprehensive... think of it more like a shove into a pool, except the pool is full of error messages and the water isn’t real.
- For the spelling and grammar slips. Sorry!

#### Alternatives:
There are myriad sources free and paid that you can learn all about python from. Some of those are:

- [learn python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- [code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)

If you end up coding regularly, you'll end up on stack ([overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [exchange](https://stackexchange.com/), [abuse](https://stackabuse.com/)).

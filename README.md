# A Really Okay Intro to Python

---

MSBA people: let me know if there are any specific things you want me to work in here. 

Planned stuff is: 
* Intermediate +:
    1. regression-2
    2. classification-2
* Misc:
    1. AWS

---

### Contents:

*Generally ordered by complexity. Knowledge and installs will build (i.e. if you skip 2. then I assume you're comfortable with pandas).*

* Beginner
1. Data Structures: overview of ways to structure data, and some elementary programming things
2. Data Framing: overview of dataframes, “data munging,” pandas, and numpy
3. Data Scraping: Selenium, accessing data that can't just be downloaded
4. Functions: class-derived example of a monte carlo simulation

* Intermediate
5. NLP-1: word clouds, intro to NLP and sklearn
6. Regression-1: overview of regression for predictive modeling, and intro to classes
7. Classification-1: intro to classification with nearest neighbors
8. Clustering: intro to K-Means clustering

* Intermediate +
9. NLP-2: text preprocessing, document similarity, and a project

#### Quickstart:
  
1. Download Anaconda
    1. [click here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
    2. scroll down a little until you see some OS tabs, and download buttons
    3. download the 3.x distribution, python 2 isn't relevant
    4. maybe make yourself a coffee or a snack, you deserve it
    5. to run: open the Anaconda app, or open a terminal and type "jupyter lab"
2. Make a github account
    1. there aren't any steps, this one is on you
3. Fork
    1. in the upper right, click the button that says fork
4. Clone
    1. on the right side, copy *HTTPS clone URL* 
    2. decide where you want to stash it (maybe in a folder called school in /Documents)
    3. open terminal and change directory to the location ("\$ cd Documents/uga")
    4. enter and run "\$ git clone *HTTPS*"
5. Enjoy!
    1. to update, open a terminal and navigate to your clone ("cd Documents/uga/Cult_Terry") and run "git pull"

### Disclaimer:

- I’m not the best - or even particularly good - at python.
- This won’t be comprehensive... think of it more like a shove into a pool, except the pool is full of error messages and the water isn’t real.
- For the spelling and grammar slips. Sorry!

- [learn python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- [code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
- [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)

If you end up coding regularly, you'll end up on stack ([overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [exchange](https://stackexchange.com/), [abuse](https://stackabuse.com/)).
